      <!-- Air Travel Section -->
      <h2>Air Travel</h2>
      <p>
        Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf
        Bay for one night per week. Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate small jets and propeller
        planes. Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the island
        within the next few years.

      <!-- Ground Transportation Section -->
      <h2>Ground Transportation</h2>
      <p>
        Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. Private buses serve the rest of the
        island. Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from a local rental agency near the
        airport. Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors (helmets are required by law). Taniti City
        is fairly flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is easy
        to explore on foot.

      <!-- Additional Transportation Options -->
      <h2>Other Transportation Options</h2>

        For those looking for an adventurous way to explore the island, consider renting a scooter or motorbike. These
        are popular options for tourists who want the freedom to explore at their own pace. Additionally, boat rentals
        are available for island-hopping and exploring Taniti’s stunning coastline.
