      <h1>Hisory of Carson City</h1>
      <p>The Consolidated Municipality of Carson City, Nevada's territorial and state capital, has a rich and colorful frontier
      past. Carson City was founded as a community in 1858, seven years after the first settlement of Eagle Station trading
      post in 1851. Eagle Valley had been settled by ranchers. Carson City is named for the famous frontiersman and scout
      Christopher "Kit" Carson. During his 1843-1844 expedition, John C. Fremont had named Carson City's nearby river for Kit
      Carson, Fremont's scout. Pioneer Abraham Curry arrived in Eagle Valley in 1858 and soon thereafter surveyed and plotted
      a town site. A cadre of well-connected attorneys whose names still decorate street signs here (Proctor, Musser) bought
      the richest part of the valley for $500 and a herd of horses. The farsighted and optimistic Curry set aside 10 acres
      expressly for the construction of a capitol -- this was before the formation of Nevada Territory in 1861. Carson City
      was soon designated both the territorial capital and county seat of the new Ormsby County. President Abraham Lincoln,
      recognizing the importance of Nevada's silver and gold to the Union's Civil War effort, signed the proclamation that
      ushered Nevada into statehood on October 31, 1864. Carson City was selected as the state capital at the constitutional
      convention and has retained that honor to the present day.
      
      Following the discovery of gold and silver on the nearby Comstock Lode in 1859, Carson City became a thriving commercial
      center. To their astonishment and delight of its citizens, the discovery of the Comstock Lode brought their Carson City
      to life as a freight and transportation center. Abe Curry, then built the crude Warm Springs Hotel a mile to the east,
      and when Carson City was selected as the territorial capital in 1861, leased it to the Legislature as a meeting hall.
      The legislature established Carson City as the seat of Ormsby County (named for one of the dead "heroes" at the Battle
      of Pyramid Lake). The legislators also leased the Warm Springs Hotel to serve as the Territorial Prison, and named their
      genial host and landlord, as its first warden. The property was eventually purchased by the state and is still a part of
      the state prison system.
      
      Carson City was confirmed as Nevada's permanent capital with statehood in 1864, and development thereafter was no longer
      completely dependent on the health of the Comstock mines. Until they began to decline in the 1880s, these mines provided
      Carson City with most of its economic importance as a freight and staging center, and as a marshalling point for much of
      the timber harvest in the Lake Tahoe basin. The United States Mint in Carson City was completed in 1869; it is today the
      site of the Nevada State Museum.
      
      The V&T was completed between Carson City and Virginia City in 1869, with the railroad's shops and main offices in
      Carson City. The V&T rails were extended north to connect with the transcontinental railroad at Reno in 1872. By 1874,
      when the Comstock mines were reaching their peak production, 36 trains a day passed through Carson City. The huge
      sandstone V&T engine house and roundtable dominated the northeast corner of the city for well over a century. Neglected
      and falling into ruin since the track was torn up in 1950, they have now been torn down and the stones sent to create
      facades for wineries in the Napa Valley.

        Like many another Nevada town in its youth Carson City was made The historic St. Charles Hotel is part of Carson City's
      revitalized historic district and is a major attraction of the modern city lively, and occasionally dangerous, by the
      presence of dozens of rootless, restless men. Shootings, stabbings and street brawls were commonplace around Nevada, but
      Carson City was unique in contending with outbreaks from the State Prison.</p>
      <p>
        Mormon agriculturists settling in the area influenced the city’s development, as did wagon and stage routes over the
        nearby Sierra Nevada passes into California. In 1859 discovery of silver in the Virginia City area, 15 miles (24 km)
        northeast, rapidly stimulated Carson City’s economy. At nearby Empire, on the Carson River, mills treated the ore of the
        Comstock Lode (one of the world’s richest deposits), brought down from Virginia City by the Virginia and Truckee
        Railroad, which maintained extensive shops at Carson City. Along with the Comstock, the railroad declined and was
        abandoned in 1950. To coin the immense silver output of the Comstock, the federal government established a mint at
        Carson City, which later became the Nevada State Museum.
