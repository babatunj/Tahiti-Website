          </div>
      <p>Reno began as the preferred crossing point of the Truckee River, an inland river that flows west to east from Lake Tahoe
      to Pyramid Lake, for travelers on their way to the California gold rush of the late 1840's and 50's. With the discovery
      of the Comstock Lode in the nearby Virginia City foothills in 1859, the river crossing became increasingly important for
      the growing trade in mining and agriculture. Reno was officially established in 1868, the same year that the
      transcontinental railroad, which paralleled the Truckee River, reached the town. In 1874, the University of Nevada was
      founded as a land-grant university, and in 1885, the primary campus was built on a rise of land overlooking Reno from
      the north. From its inception, the university was an integral component of the young town’s identity and contributed to
      Reno’s reputation as a cultural center. This was reflected in Reno’s nickname, “Biggest Little City in the World,” which
      arose as a result of the wide range of cosmopolitan amenities in a city of its relatively small size. </p>
      <p>
        Reno became a quickie divorce destination in the early 1900's, and in 1931, Nevada legalized gambling. Reno was a front
        runner in creating the model of destination hotel/casino gaming – a model which has been replicated throughout the
        world. Virginia Street, the primary north/south arterial through downtown, developed into a commercial center of
        moderately-scaled, locally-owned destination hotel/casinos and retail stores. The transcontinental Lincoln Highway (now
        4th street), passed through the heart of downtown and many motor lodges sprang up on either side of the Virginia Street
        core to support booming post-war automobile tourism. For most of the 20th century, tourism and the gaming and
        entertainment industries formed the backbone of Reno’s economy.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1947, Reno saw its first high-rise casino hotel, the Mapes Hotel. Its structure soon became the model for future
        businesses to set up shop in Reno. The last half of the 20th century was a prosperous time for The Biggest Little City
        in the World.
        
        As the 20th century was nearing its end, the business had slowed significantly for Reno. In order to survive in a new
        age, the city began to look for new ways to draw visitors. Reno remains the second largest tourist city in the state
        with a broad array of entertainment options for travelers.

        <h3 class="h3margin">Economy</h3>
        <hr class="headingmargin">
        <p>
          Until the 1960s, Reno was the gambling capital of the United States, but Las Vegas' rapid growth, American Airlines'
          2000 buyout of Reno Air, and the growth of Native American gaming in California have reduced its gambling economy. Older
          casinos were torn down (Mapes Hotel, Fitzgerald's Nevada Club, Primadonna, Horseshoe Club, Harold's Club, Palace Club),
          or smaller casinos like the Comstock, Sundowner, Golden Phoenix, Kings Inn, Money Tree, Virginian, and Riverboat were
          either closed or were converted into residential units.<br>
          
          Because of its location, Reno has traditionally drawn the majority of its California tourists and gamblers from the San
          Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento while Las Vegas has historically served more tourists from Southern California and the
          Phoenix area.<br>
          
          Several local large hotel casinos have shown significant growth and have moved gaming further away from the downtown
          core. These larger hotel casinos are the Atlantis, the Peppermill and the Grand Sierra Resort. The Peppermill was chosen
          as the most outstanding Reno gaming/hotel property by Casino Player and Nevada magazines. In 2005, the Peppermill Reno
          began a $300 million Tuscan-themed expansion.<br>
          
          Reno holds several events throughout the year to draw tourists to the area. They include Hot August Nights (a
          classic car convention), Street Vibrations (a motorcycle fan gathering and rally), The Great Reno Balloon Race, a Cinco
          de Mayo celebration, bowling tournaments (held in the National Bowling Stadium), and the Reno Air Races.<br>
          
          Several large commercial developments were constructed during the mid-2000s boom, such as The Summit in 2007 and Legends
          at Sparks Marina in 2008.<br>
          
          Reno is the location of the corporate headquarters for several companies, including Braeburn Capital, Hamilton, Server
          Technology, EE Technologies, Caesars Entertainment, and Port of Subs. Companies based in the Reno metropolitan area
          include Sierra Nevada Corporation and U.S. Ordnance. International Game Technology, Bally Technologies and GameTech have
          a development and manufacturing presence.<br>
          
          Since the turn of the 21st century, greater Reno saw an influx of technology companies entering the area, following
          major initiatives and investments by investors from Seattle & the Bay Area. The first one in 1999 was Amazon.com in
          Fernley. After the Great Recession, the state placed an increased focus on economic development. Thousands of new jobs
          were created.<br>
          
          The Tesla Gigafactory at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center is the largest building in the world, purportedly covering 5.8
          million square feet.<br>
          
          The arrival of several data centers at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center is further diversifying a region that was best
          known for distribution and logistics outside gaming and tourism. Switch's new SuperNAP campus at the Tahoe Reno
          Industrial Center is shaping up to be the largest data center in the world once completed. Apple is expanding its data
          center at the adjacent Reno Technology Park and recently built a warehouse on land in downtown Reno. Rackspace is also
          building a $422 million data center next to Apple.
          The greater Reno area also hosts distribution facilities for Amazon, Walmart, PetSmart and Zulily </p>
